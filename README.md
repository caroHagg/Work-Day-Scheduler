# Work-Day-Scheduler
This webpage will help you create a daily schedule/planner. You will see the current date at the top of the page. You will see time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block will be color coded depending on the time of day. 

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
